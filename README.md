## 1. 🛠️ TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

**HYDRA-UMC-JOB-DISPATCHER** is the task allocation engine of the Orchestrator. it manages a global mission queue, distributing jobs to individual robots based on their current availability, location, and attached tool (URTC).

It ensures that high-priority tasks (e.g., "Emergency Defect Fix") bypass the normal production flow, and coordinates multi-step assembly sequences that require different robots to work in tandem.

### Key Features:
* 📋 **Dynamic Queueing:** Intelligent mission prioritization and scheduling.
* ⚖️ **Tool-Aware Routing:** Automatically routes jobs to the robot with the correct URTC head.
* 🔄 **Multi-Stage Missions:** Manages dependencies between tasks (e.g., "Pick" must happen before "Place").
* 📡 **Persistence:** Fault-tolerant mission state using local Redis/Database storage.
* 🔁 **Idempotent Submission (v0):** Real, opt-in `DedupKey`-based deduplication via `POST /jobs/submit` - a retried submission of an in-flight or already-done job is returned unchanged, and a retry after a real failure reuses the same job ID instead of running the work twice. Priority ordering is deterministic across repeated runs, covered by an explicit regression test.

## 3. 🧱 ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN DECISIONS

* **Why the real logic lives under `src/`, not at the repo root.** `src/dispatcher` (the scheduling engine) and `src/api` (the HTTP handlers) hold the actual implementation; `main.go`/`version.go` stay at the repo root as the entry point that wires them together.
* **Why job assignment checks tool availability via URTC.** A job that needs a specific tool head is only dispatchable to a robot whose URTC-controlled tool head is actually present and idle - checking this before dispatch (not after a failed pick) avoids a robot arriving at a station it can't actually use. `src/dispatcher.Engine.DispatchOnce` enforces this today by exact `RequiredTool`/`Robot.Tool` match; it doesn't yet talk to a real URTC over CAN to confirm the tool head is physically attached (this engine only knows what a robot registration claims - see `src/api`'s `POST /robots`).
* **Why the scheduler is real today but persistence is not.** `src/dispatcher` implements the actual algorithm the README's "DISPATCHER FLOW" diagram describes: a priority-ordered global queue, tool-aware routing, and multi-stage dependencies (a job stays `blocked` until every job it `DependsOn` reaches `done`). It keeps all of that in memory only - `Engine`'s state lives behind exported methods precisely so a Redis/DB-backed store can replace what's behind them later without changing every caller. Proving the scheduling algorithm itself correct came first.
* **Why the HTTP API is plain JSON/HTTP, not gRPC.** This is a human/ops-facing control surface (submit a job, register a robot, ask what happened) - `hydra.common.v1` (the ecosystem's shared gRPC contract, see `HYDRA-UMC-ORCHESTRATOR/proto/`) stays reserved for node-to-node traffic, per that proto's own documented scope.
* **How this fits the rest of the ecosystem.** A sibling service under HYDRA-UMC-ORCHESTRATOR - turns mission-level decisions into concrete per-robot job assignments, checked against URTC tool availability and HYDRA-UMC-PATH-PLANNER-3D's own routes.
* **Why `POST /jobs/submit` is a new route instead of changing `POST /jobs`.** `AddJob()`/`POST /jobs` always insert and error on an ID collision - that low-level contract is untouched. `SubmitJob()`/`POST /jobs/submit` layers real, opt-in deduplication on top via `Job.DedupKey`: same pattern used across the ecosystem (a safety-gated entry point added alongside an unchanged low-level primitive, not a behavior change bolted onto it).
* **Why a retry-after-failure reuses the same job ID instead of creating a new job.** The alternative - minting a fresh job on every retry - would scatter one logical unit of work's history across several IDs and give a caller no way to tell "this failed once and is being retried" from "this is unrelated new work". Resetting the original job back to `Pending` keeps its whole lifecycle (including the failed attempt) under one ID.

## 🔧 BUILD & RUN GUIDE

A real priority mission queue with an HTTP API, not just a skeleton that compiles.

```bash
# Windows
build.bat
run.bat -addr :8090

# Linux / macOS
./build.sh
./run.sh -addr :8090
```

`build.sh`/`build.bat` bump the version in `version.go` (ecosystem-wide
odometer rule, see `bump_version.py` - `go.mod` has no native version field
for application binaries) and then run `go build`. `run.sh`/`run.bat`
execute the resulting binary directly.

```bash
# Register a robot, submit a job, dispatch it, then mark it done
curl -X POST localhost:8090/robots -d '{"id":"robot-a","tool":"PnP","available":true}'
curl -X POST localhost:8090/jobs   -d '{"id":"job-1","priority":5,"requiredTool":"PnP"}'
curl -X POST localhost:8090/dispatch -d '{}'
curl -X POST localhost:8090/jobs/complete -d '{"id":"job-1","success":true}'
curl localhost:8090/jobs
curl localhost:8090/robots
```

```bash
# Idempotent submission: a retried request with the same dedupKey never
# runs the same job twice, even if the client used a different job id.
curl -X POST localhost:8090/jobs/submit -d '{"id":"job-2","priority":5,"requiredTool":"PnP","dedupKey":"req-abc"}'
# -> {"ID":"job-2", ..., "result":"created"}
curl -X POST localhost:8090/jobs/submit -d '{"id":"job-2-retry","priority":5,"requiredTool":"PnP","dedupKey":"req-abc"}'
# -> {"ID":"job-2", ..., "result":"duplicate"} - same job, untouched

# After a real failure, a retry with the same dedupKey reuses job-2's ID:
curl -X POST localhost:8090/jobs/complete -d '{"id":"job-2","success":false}'
curl -X POST localhost:8090/jobs/submit -d '{"id":"job-2-retry-2","priority":5,"requiredTool":"PnP","dedupKey":"req-abc"}'
# -> {"ID":"job-2", "Status":"pending", ..., "result":"retried"}
```

```bash
go test ./...   # src/dispatcher (scheduling algorithm) +
                 # src/api (real HTTP round-trips via httptest)
```

## 🚀 ROADMAP
* **Phase 1:** Deterministic swarm synchronization over TSN and sub-ms jitter reduction.
* **Phase 2:** 3D Path planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance in multi-robot cells.
* **Phase 3:** Multi-robot job dispatching optimization using real-time resource availability.
* **Phase 4:** AI-driven job duration estimation for better scheduling and heterogeneous robot fleet coordination.
